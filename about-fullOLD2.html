                    <h2>Our Full Story</h2>
                    <p>At One Gear Garage, BMX isn’t just a ride—it’s a ritual.</p>
                    <p>I’ve always had a love for bikes—especially street and dirt bikes. But when my truck went into the shop and I lost my job, I ended up in a situation I never expected.</p>
                    <p>With no way to get around and no money to fix the truck (which is still in the shop), I had to figure something out.</p>
                    <p>That’s when I bought my first pedal bike since I was a kid—the one in the photo. What started out as a backup plan quickly became a passion. I got into doing tricks, learning how to maintain and upgrade my bike, and understanding how everything worked.</p>
                    <p>Before I knew it, I was dreaming about tricks I couldn’t even do yet. That bike became my transportation, my training ground, and my outlet. I’ve put countless miles on it, and it’s never let me down.</p>
                    <p>These simple, human-powered machines are more powerful than people think. I built One Gear Garage to share that same reliability and freedom with other riders.</p>
